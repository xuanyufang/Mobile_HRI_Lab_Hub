## 1 Interaction Videos

We filmed four interaction videos with people including voice and motion interaction. It did not involve different participants without instructions due to multiple reasons: we are still finalizing the design of the umbrella part of the robot, which is essential for users to understand its function; the volume of the speaker is too low to be heard; and most importantly, the speed is not controllable at this moment to be safely used with other people. We will test with more participants when the umbrella is attached and a fully runnable prototype is delivered. 

### 1.0 Interaction Location

We imagined that the umbrella bot would be placed in an open space which is outside of a building with limited shelter for rain. The umbrella bot would wander around when the day is sunny. Once it starts raining, the bot would go look for people standing either in the rain or in the shelter and ask if they need an umbrella. If the answer is positive, the umbrella bot would escort and follow them to their destinations.

### 1.1 Asking People and Escorting

As shown in this video, it features the majority function of the Umbrellabot, which is interacting with people to pick them up in the rain, and then escort them to somewhere dry or their desired location. In the video, we filmed the motion and voice interaction between the robot and the user, where users will be asking whether they’d want to take an umbrella which is signaled by a rotating motion as well and if yes, the Umbrellabot will open its umbrella and start escorting the user.

### 1.2 Asking People and Leaving

The Umbrellabot will also be able to respond to different signals given by the user. If the user turns down the umbrella but by saying no to its offering, the Umbrellabot will turn around and say goodbye to the user so it’s able to locate the next user that’s in need.

### 1.3 Avoiding Pedestrians When Moving

As shown in this video, the Umbrellabot is capable of automatically avoiding pedestrians when moving around. In our design, the Umbrellabot will detect people that might be too close to them and find a detour to pass by the pedestrian while using sound to alert them in case of collision. In the video, we have pictured the interaction that the Umbrellabot going around the incoming pedestrian while moving around, which will be an instant interaction between the robot and human.

### 1.4 Finishing Escorting People

When the Umbrellabot finished escorting the user that interacted with it, they’ll be notified by the user, or through their sensor that they arrived at the designated location. When they received a signal from the user through voice communication like “I’ve arrived” or “Here would be fine” as shown in the video, the Umbrellabot will find a safe distance from people and close its umbrella for next use. It will also greet the user and notify them that it’s leaving as a closure of the interaction.

## 2 Reflections

Throughout this lab session, we found out that there were still opportunities where we could improve. First of all, we found that the robustness of the robot itself can be improved as the screw loosened as we drove the robot around in an open space. We will need to strengthen the structure of the umbrella bot in the future lab with an improved overall design. While we were staging the interaction, we also found that the sound coming out of the speaker was not loud enough in an open space where noises were presented.  We will need to figure out a way to increase the volume to make sure people can hear the instructions and interact with the robot wuithout any problems. Finally, we also found that the robot moved way too fast while interacting with people. The speed of the robot is so fast that it will easily make people scared of it when the robot comes close as there are no active or passive protective mechanisms to keep the robot from colliding with people. To solve this problem, we will need to tune the configuration of the wheels to make sure the speed won’t scare people interacting with the robot.
