## Part A. Provide Feedback

*   **AngelBot**

    The video successfully captures the functionality of AngelBot, but has a rather simple interaction which possibilities can be better explored. This idea is a very interesting concept that is similar to a robotic pet that has been around for a while, but more of a desktop version. We generally like it very much!

*   **ButterBot**

    The video interaction of butter bot conveys the message precisely on its function, an interesting reference to Rick & Morty! The voice interaction in the video is also very interesting and vivid. The design of the bot can be a bit more complex in its functionalities other than just passing around the butter.

*   **ChargerBot**

    This is a great idea! Our favorite among all three as well. The video of the interaction with ChargerBot is also very precise in demonstrating its possibilities in managing the cables in desktop scenarios. I would certainly use it if there’s anything like it actually being built eventually.
    
    I loved all the ideas that the team developed for their robot. They were quite futuristic and creative. I could easily follow the ButterBot video - it was obvious to me what the purpose of the robot was, and I could see this being used in homes for similar usecases. I was not able to follow the AngelBot video clearly - it might have been more helpful to see an actual human in distress - nevertheless once I read the sketches and descriptions, I could easily follow what was happening in the video. My favorite was the ChargerBot! That is a robot I would actively engage with in my daily life.
    
One of the aspects I enjoyed most about their storyboards and videos were that they focused on functional ideas for their robot. Each of the robot's goals had utility, and it was nice to see the differences in the ways of our ideation process. I also really enjoyed looking through their storyboards. They did an excellent job at conveying the scene and goal of the robot in an enjoyable, digestible style.

Wow, your robots are clearly thoughtfully designed and well-implemented. The angel bot is cute and has some semblance of emotional intelligence; the butter has comedy and usefulness; the charger bot is super useful and intelligent. Robot-specific feedback, questions, and ideas:

Does the charger bot need to stay there for the entire duration of the charging process? Can it detach itself or move away when the charging is happening? Maybe it could also indicate when the device is done charging, so the human does not keep their device plugged in for too long.

The angel bot is really sweet. It seems that most of the functionality comes from the servo motor on top, which has a pretty limited motion option. I think what you have works, but you may need to think about the material and presentation for whatever you attach to it.

I think the butter bot is so funny. The shaking back and forth is such a clever way to execute the emotion of anguish that a robot can feel about only having the purpose of being a butter bot.

## Part B. Site the interaction

\*\***Sketch and/or take photos of the site(s) you are considering.**\*\*

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/02/14/t1VgjDrKBGpniI8.jpg" alt="site.jpeg" style="zoom:15%;" />

\*\***Document the activities being considered.**\*\*

*   The designed scenario of the bot from the last lab we chose was mainly on desktop. We are choosing the ChargerBot to prototype. The ChargerBot is mainly used indoors, on a daily basis with a purpose of better and smarter desktop management. The interactions are all designed to be on a desk, due to that’s where the majority of charging behaviors happened in daily lives of users with their laptop. 
*   The ChargerBot was meant to be used in an individual setting (or not being used within a group at the same time). The major player is the user and the bot, while in the space the presence of smart devices is also necessary. ChargerBot will be able to provide charging for first of all, mainly laptops, and secondly, smartphones and smart watches at the same time. 
*   ChargerBot essentially detects user signals on the desktop and comes to the user when charging devices are needed, it comes with extension cords to better assist usage of laptops, and also with wireless charging for smartphones and smartwatches. 

\*\***What issues or opportunties arise from the site and activities?**\*\*

*   A major problem on the desktop of many people who usually perform tasks on a laptop is around wire organization and also how to clean up the desk when charging & extension cords are not needed. An integrated robot that perform the charging task when needed and leaves the desk clean when not is essential to a better laptop usage experience on desktops. 

## Part C. Costume the robot

\*\***Include sketches of what your robot might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***Include photos of your custumed robot here.**\*\*

*   **Charger Ports**

    The ChargerBot has three types of charger ports at the front (MagSafe, Type-C and Lightening).

*   **Apple Watch Wireless Charger**

    At the right side of the ChargerBot, there is a wireless charger for Apple Watch.

*   **Extension Ports**

    At the left side of the ChargerBot, there is a extension hub.

*   **Wireless Phone Charger**

    You can charge your phone using the wireless phone charger at the top of the ChargerBot.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the robot to look?**\*\*

Through designing the robot, we found that there’s possible room on the robot for many other common needs on the desktop other than just charging the laptop, first of all, charging other commonly used smart devices like smartphones or smartwatches. Another function we thought of, or opportunity we identified is that other than just charging the laptop, people often need to plug in an extension cord to the laptop when using it on a desktop that they are familiar with. We then also designed an extension cord on the robot to perform certain tasks. 

## Part D. Wizard the Robot

Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the robot while someone interacts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

After test it out for the first time, we found out that there’re two major issues that can be improved:

*   The charging cable in front of the robot is too long, which not only will touch the desktop and possibly be broken during transportation, but also have the chance to influence the robot’s capability of moving around. We then changed the position of inner wiring to make sure the length of outside wires is appropriate in moving, and also easy for the user to grab.
*   We found out that the other side of the extension cord compared to the robot has a little imbalance in weight, which causes the robot to tilt to one side when moving. We then designed the smart watch wireless charging module with more matched weight with the other side of the robot.

## Part E. Record

\*\***Take videos of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Special thanks to **<u>Zooey Zhang</u>** who generously provided an Apple Watch, helped with recording the interaction video and brought Yutong her favorite jasmine ice-cream.


\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
