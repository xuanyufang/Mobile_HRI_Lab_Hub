## 0. Idea Development
We started this project with the idea that we could make the umbrella move. Nearly everyone had the experience of walking in the rain, holding an umbrella with one hand, and finding it difficult to hold other stuff. Therefore, we developed the idea that we could make the umbrella automatically follow people and shelter them while they’re walking. Our original idea also includes a mobile working station that’s installed beneath the umbrella, which allows people to work outdoors regardless of the weather. People could also use the workstation protected by the umbrella to charge their electronic devices. However, we have given up on the workstation part due to time and prototyping issues which will be explained in detail in Section 1.


## 1. Prototyping

*  Cardboard
We first started with a cardboard prototype just to see whether it would move. The good news is, it does, the bad news is, not for long:

* Wood + Acrylic
After a couple of cardboard prototypes, we transit to actually make this robot happens. Recognizing the difficulties of supporting a tall structure of an umbrella, we have planned to use the thick wooden board to build a steady base. We started with laser cutting & hand sawing most of the wood structures and then used wood glue and zip ties to build a four supporting-wheel base.
