## 1 Three Ideas

### 1.1 Detection Feedback

The rumble feature is able to detect and alert certain things like collisions through cameras or sensors, or to locate a target when trying to find something/someone. This feature is used when the user controls the robot with the controller. For example, if the robot bumps into a wall, the controller can vibrate to let the user know that the robot has stopped moving.



### 1.2 Interaction Signals

The rumble feature can also be used as a signal when the user interacts with the robot instead of controlling the robot. For example, when the moving robot is mimicking a pokemon that walks around the room, the user can use throw gestures with the controller to capture the pokemon, and the pokemon robot can use the rumble feature on the controller as its representing the Pokeball.



### 1.3 Emotion Recognition

The rumble feature can also provide the user with feedback on the emotional state of the robot. For example, the rumble could become stronger when the robot is happy or excited, or weaker when it is sad or anxious, it can also convey emotions according to the text or sound message that the robot is currently delivering to the user of the robot.
