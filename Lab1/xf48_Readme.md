## Lab Overview

A) [Build Your Clonebot](#part-a-build-your-clonebot)

B) [Plan](#part-b-plan) 

C) [Act out the interaction](#part-c-act-out-the-interaction) 

### Deliverables for this lab are: 

1. 5 Storyboards
2. Any reflections you have on the process
3. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions (selected from the 5 storyboards)
4. Submit the items above in the Lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. **Each group member should have the updated lab page linked to their own Lab Hub.** Better yet, you could replicate the data in your own repo so that you don't lose anything if your partner modifies or deletes their files later.

## Part A. Build Your Clonebot



## Part B. Plan

To stage an interaction with your CloneBot, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., an office, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? Reflect on the design of current day home mobile robots like Roomba. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., picking up a pen, opening the fridge). 

Leverage the possible motions of Clonebot and the extra degree of freedom provided by the motor on the top.

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch five storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the CloneBot and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

## Part C. Act out the Interaction

Select 3 of the 5 storyboards to act out. Try physically enacting the 3 interactions you planned with your teammates. (Do not plug in the CloneBot just yet.) Record these video clips, and submit them (Unlisted Youtube links are fine).

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
